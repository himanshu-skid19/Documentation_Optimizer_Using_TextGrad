Add more context to the description of the API.\n2. Provide more information about the expected input types and constraints.\n3. Include examples of what the returned data should look like.\n\nHere's an updated version of the documentation with these suggestions incorporated:\n\n```\nCreate a new user account.\n\nDescription:\nThis endpoint creates a new user account based on the provided name, age, and email.\n\nParameters\n- `name`: User's name (string)\n- `age`: User's age (integer)\n- `email`: User's email address (string)\n\nReturns:\nA JSON object containing the created user data\n\nExamples\nuser = create_user(name=\"John\", age=25)\n```\n\n**Technical Accuracy**\n\nThe information provided is accurate and precise.

Please refer to our security documentation for more information on authentication mechanisms and error handling procedures.\n```\n\n**Suggestions**\n\n1. Add more context to the description of the API by including details about its purpose and how it works.\n2. Provide more information about the expected input types and constraints, such as specifying that `name` should be a string and `age` should be an integer.\n3.
